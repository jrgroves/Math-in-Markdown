A quadratic equation looks like $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

The quadratic formula is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

$\forall x >= 0$ there exists a number that is its negative.

Solve for $x$.

Now we are going to add a branch and pull request when we commit

The solution to the quadratic euquation is given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

If we are using the complete the square approach, we would solve:

$$x^2 + bx = c$$
$$x^2 + bx + (\frac{b}{2})^2 = c + (\frac{b}{2})^2$$

If we are estimating a regression, we want to estimate:

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i$$
