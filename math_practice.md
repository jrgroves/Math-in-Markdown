A quadratic equation looks like $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

The quadratic formula is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

$\forall x >= 0$ there exists a number that is its negative.

Solve for $x$.

Now we are going to add a branch and pull request when we commit

The solution to the quadratic euquation is given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

If we are using the complete the square approach, we would solve:

$$x^2 + bx = c$$
$$x^2 + bx + (\frac{b}{2})^2 = c + (\frac{b}{2})^2$$

If we are estimating a regression, we want to estimate:

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i$$

We can create a matrix to look like this:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

So now, let's create a matrix of matricies:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B \\
C & D 
\end{pmatrix} 
&
\begin{pmatrix}
E & F \\
G & H 
\end{pmatrix} 
\\
\begin{pmatrix}
I & J \\
K & L 
\end{pmatrix} 
&
\begin{pmatrix}
|M| & N \\
O & P 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
3x &+ 2y &= 1 \\
 x &+ y &= 0
 \end{align}
 $$
 
# The Euler Identity

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

This elegant equation, known as Euler's Identity, connects five fundamental mathematical constants:
- $e$ (Euler's number)
- $i$ (the imaginary unit)
- $\pi$ (pi)
- 1 (the multiplicative identity)
- 0 (the additive identity)

It's often regarded as one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics, showing a deep connection between exponential functions and trigonometry, as $e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi) = -1$.

The Profit of a firm can be found using:

$$
Profit = \underbrace{Price * Quantity}_{\text{Total Revenue}} - \underbrace{Cost * Quantity}{_\text{Total Costs}}
$$
